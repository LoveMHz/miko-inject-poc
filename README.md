## About
In 2022, a group of developers proposed decompiling one of my favorite series on the original Xbox, Fatal Frame/Project Zero.

I've always admired the 'one piece at a time' approach to decompilation, especially after discovering the [Metal Gear Solid Integral PC](https://github.com/MrSapps/msgi) project by MrSapps. This method reimplements game logic incrementally through DLL injection and redirection.

Inspired by this, I wanted to apply a similar technique on the Xbox. However, instead of using DLL injection, I had planned to directly attach new code sections to a newly created XBE file.

## State
The proof of concept works but could use some cleaning up and optimization. The project has been abandoned since 2022 because the decompilation project took a different direction. 

Despite this, the initial work lays a solid foundation for anyone interested in picking up where it left off. There is potential for improvement and expansion if someone is willing to invest the time and effort.
